# Pangram

This repository is intended as a teaching resource to teach the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) JavaScript testing framework.

## Problem Description

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma,
"every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.
The best known English pangram is:
> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters `a` to `z`, inclusive, and is case
insensitive. Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols.

## Setup

From the project directory, install the necessary dependency (jest)

```bash
$ `npm install -g jest-cli`
$ `npm install`
$ `npm start````

## Running the test suite

Run the test suite from the exercise directory with:

```bash
npm test
```

Most of the tests are stubbed out and incomplete.  In the course of the exercise complete the tests.
